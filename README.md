# samir_script
## About:
samir_script is a high level interpreted dynamically strongly typed multi-paradigm scripting language, Created by me as a hobby.
# Get started:
## What to download ?
Simply download the samir_script.jar file, This is the entirety of the interpreter, You can optionally download the samir_script sample programs to test the interpreter, You will need to have Java installed in order to run the interpreter.
## running samir_script
If you're on Windows then simply open up CMD and type the following ```java -jar (path to the interpreter here) "(path to samir_script program here)" ```
Don't forget to wrap the samir_script program path with parentheses, Typing this everytime you wanna run a program is very tedious, So consider creating a .cmd file that can automate the process of running programs, I personally have a run.cmd file that contains the following: ```java -jar C:\Users\Samir\Desktop\code\Java\samir_script\samir_script.jar "C:\Users\Samir\Desktop\test.smr"
PAUSE ```
